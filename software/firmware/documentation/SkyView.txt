SkyView documentation
=====================

By Moshe Braner
This version last updated January 29, 2023 to fit version MB05


This document only mentions what I have changed in SkyView.  For general information about what SkyView is, how to build it, and how to use it, can be found here:  https://github.com/lyusupov/SoftRF/wiki/SkyView-EZ

Skyview offers voice notifications of nearby traffic.  The original version behaves as follows: as soon as another aircraft (with a compatible device transmitting) gets closer than 10 km from this aircraft, a voice notification announces it's relative position (bearing, distance and altitude).  After that, no further notifications are given about the same aircraft, unless it travels out of range and later comes back.

Thus, you may get an audio notification about an aircraft that is sort-of-close but not a danger yet, then you'll get a notification about some other aircraft that is sort-of-close (even if 2000 feet above you?), and meanwhile the first aircraft may be approaching closer in a dangerous way but you won't hear about it.

Moreover, the voice notifications were only based on PFLAA sentences from FLARM or SoftRF, and not the PFLAU sentences.  But the latter are supposed to be the primary collision warnings, and there is no guarantee that the same aircraft will also be reported in a PFLAA sentence.

In my view this is useless as a collision avoidance tool.  So I revised the behavior as follows:  Based on the "alarm level" for each reported aircraft, which is included in those "sentences", a voice warning is given about the aircraft that is at the highest alarm level.  (There are 3 levels, predicting a possible collision within 0-8, 9-12, and 13-19 seconds - reporting in Skyview may be a second or two later than when these were computed.)  If there are two aircraft at the same highest level, the closer one is chosen.  Once a warning is given about an aircraft, no further warnings are given at the same alarm level.  But if the aircraft's alarm level increases, or if it first decreases and then increases to what it was before, then another warning is given about the same aircraft.

These voice warnings are given based on both PFLAU and PFLAA sentences.

As a secondary feature, only when there are no aircraft around that are considered a collision danger (to avoid distraction), voice traffic advisories are given about other aircraft when they first get closer than 6 km (about 4 miles) from this aircraft.  After that, no further notifications are given about the same aircraft, unless its signal is lost and regained, or if it goes outside of that threshold and then returns.  Also, if that aircraft is later deemed to be a collision danger, the warning messages are given as explained above.

In addition, I made the following further changes:
* Collision danger voice warnings are short, e.g., "danger, 3 o'clock, high".
* Traffic advisories are longer, e.g., "traffic, 3 o'clock, 2 miles, 500 feet above".
* Collision danger voice warnings are given in a female voice speaking rapidly
* Traffic advisories are given in a male voice speaking more slowly.
* Reduced the volume of the advisories 6dB to make it about level with the female voice.
* The settings now only allow voice on or off, no choice of voices - see above.

Skyview also offers the option of loading into its SD card a database of aircraft, so that they can be displayed on the screen with the tail (competition) number, registration, or make and model.  I have replaced the use of SQLITE in SkyView.  Instead, it now uses uCDB, similar to the "Badge Edition" of SoftRF.  Put the file ogn.cdb in the Aircrafts folder on the SD card.  A recent copy of ogn.cdb is in the software/data/Aircrafts folder.  An up to date copy can be downloaded at any time from http://soaringweather.no-ip.info/ADB/data  At this time only the OGN data is available in this format, not the Flarmnet data nor ICAO.
